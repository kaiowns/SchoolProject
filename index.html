      <h2>üåç Introduction to Religious Diversity</h2>
      <p>Religions provide answers to humanity‚Äôs biggest questions: why we‚Äôre here, what happens after we die, how we should live. Despite differences, they share common goals‚Äîpromoting values, moral guidelines, and community. This project explores four major religions: Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, and Judaism, each with their own traditions, sacred texts, and understanding of divinity.</p>
