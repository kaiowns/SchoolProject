      <h2>Welcome to Our Journey</h2>
      <p>Religion has been part of human life for thousands of years. Whether it's finding purpose, understanding the universe, or building a sense of community, people everywhere have looked to religion for guidance. In this project, we explore four of the world's major religions and how they approach life, belief, forgiveness, and daily rituals. It’s not about comparing who's right—just learning how beautifully diverse humans can be.</p>

      <h2>Islam</h2>
      <p>Islam is followed by over a billion people around the world. The word "Islam" means peace and submission—submission to the one and only God, Allah.</p>
      <h3>What do Muslims believe about God?</h3>
      <p>Allah is the one true God. Muslims believe He’s compassionate, all-knowing, and always near. No images or statues represent Him—just words and faith.</p>
      <h3>The Quran</h3>
      <p>The Quran is Islam’s holy book. It's seen as the literal word of God revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. It guides everything from prayer to daily decisions.</p>
      <h3>How Muslims Practice</h3>
      <p>From praying five times a day to fasting during Ramadan, Islamic life is centered around worship, charity, and kindness. The pilgrimage to Mecca is a spiritual goal for all Muslims.</p>
      <h3>Forgiveness in Islam</h3>
      <p>Muslims believe God loves to forgive. People are encouraged to admit mistakes, ask for forgiveness, and try to do better.</p>

  </section>  <section id="christianity">
    <div class="card" data-aos="fade-right">
      <h2>Christianity</h2>
      <p>Christianity is based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. Christians believe Jesus is the Son of God who came to bring salvation to everyone.</p>
      <h3>Belief in God</h3>
      <p>Christians believe in one God expressed as the Father, the Son (Jesus), and the Holy Spirit. The message is clear: God is love.</p>
      <h3>The Bible</h3>
      <p>The Bible is a collection of books—stories, poetry, wisdom—that tell the journey of God's people and the life of Jesus.</p>
      <h3>Christian Practice</h3>
      <p>Church services, prayer, singing, and acts of kindness are common practices. Special days like Christmas and Easter celebrate key moments in Jesus' life.</p>
      <h3>Forgiveness in Christianity</h3>
      <p>Forgiveness is at the heart of Christian belief. Jesus taught people to forgive others as God forgives them—with love and grace.</p>

      <h2>Buddhism</h2>
      <p>Buddhism is more of a way of life than a religion. It’s about understanding suffering, letting go of selfishness, and becoming truly aware of the world.</p>
      <h3>Is there a God in Buddhism?</h3>
      <p>Not really. Buddhists focus on spiritual growth and personal wisdom instead of worshipping a creator god.</p>
      <h3>Buddhist Texts</h3>
      <p>The teachings of the Buddha are recorded in many books, like the Tripitaka. These texts offer guidance for meditation and ethical living.</p>
      <h3>Daily Life for Buddhists</h3>
      <p>Buddhists meditate, reflect, and practice compassion. They avoid harming others and aim for balance in everything they do.</p>
      <h3>Forgiveness in Buddhism</h3>
      <p>Letting go of anger and resentment is key to inner peace. Forgiveness is a gift you give to yourself as much as to others.</p>

    <div class="card" data-aos="zoom-in">
      <h2>Judaism</h2>
      <p>Judaism is one of the oldest religions still practiced today. It’s a faith rooted in tradition, law, and a deep sense of history and community.</p>
      <h3>What do Jews believe about God?</h3>
      <p>Jews believe in one God who is both just and loving. This God made a promise—a covenant—with the Jewish people to guide and protect them.</p>
      <h3>The Torah</h3>
      <p>The Torah contains laws, stories, and instructions for how to live a meaningful life. It’s read weekly in synagogue and studied with care.</p>
      <h3>Practices and Traditions</h3>
      <p>Jewish life includes holidays like Passover, weekly rest on the Sabbath, and special foods prepared in a kosher way. It’s about remembering and honoring the past.</p>
      <h3>Forgiveness in Judaism</h3>
      <p>Before Yom Kippur, Jews seek forgiveness from others and from God. It’s not just about words—it’s about making things right.</p>

      <h2>What We Learned</h2>
      <p>Whether it's praying, meditating, lighting candles, or studying sacred books, people all over the world are trying to answer the same big questions. What's right and wrong? Why are we here? How do we live a good life? Religion is one way humans express those answers—and learning about them helps us understand each other just a little better.</p>
